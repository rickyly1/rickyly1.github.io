## Description
Welcome to my personal portfolio page! The design and formatting is largely based on my first custom portfolio, but with several added features.

## Table of Contents

## Design
  My approach to designing this portfolio was to keep things simple and clean. I opted for a black-and-white scheme since I quite enjoy how larger swaths of whitespace look. Where I could add color I tried to put semantic reason into the decision, such as making a confirmation button green.

## Features
- Complete responsiveness across all viewports, done using media queries and relative measurements.
- A collapsing navbar-to-hamburger menu at smaller viewports
- An infinitely scrolling marquee wheel
- Contact form utilizing EmailJS

## Installation (Customization)
1. Install dependencies and React
   ```shell
   npm install
2. Edit EmailJS template and keys in "Contact.js"

   Or if you want to take a look just go to [http:rickyly1.github.io](https://rickyly1.github.io/)

  Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed my portfolio!
